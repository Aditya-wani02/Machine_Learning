# Normalization

Normalization in machine learning refers to the process of scaling or transforming numerical features of a dataset to a standard range. The goal of normalization is to bring all the features to a similar scale, so that no single feature dominates the learning process or creates biases in the model due to its magnitude. It is an essential preprocessing step for many machine learning algorithms, particularly those that rely on distance-based calculations or gradient descent optimization.
